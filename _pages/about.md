Hello World!
First and foremost, I've embarked on what has been (and likely will continue to be) a trying journey of learning to code. This is the first page I've "created," courtesy of the template made by [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), but hopefully not the last. Should you choose to follow me along this journey, may we see updates, advancements, and all-around growth in the coming months and years.

Moving on, I am a geography graduate student finishing up my first year at Penn State University interested and working within the realms of politics, economics, and community. My fundamental interest is around belonging: What does it mean to belong? What is the role of capital? And what other forces/structures exist that keep certain communities from forming and how? That has taken the form of research focused on how college and universities interact with their towns and cities, and the ways in which they shape, reshape, and un-shape communities. This is the impetus for my learning how to code which has been grueling, confusing, and frustrating; I've been told I have hedonistic tendencies, so you can bet that these are matters and questions that are extremely important to me. I intend on continuing this uncharacteristic endeavor through both quantitative and qualitative means. Hopefully along the way, I'll figure out a succinct way to talk about why this kind of mixed-methods approach is appealing to me and how impactful I imagine it could be. 

One of the reasons why I'm a geographer is because of how ubiquitous and porous it is. Of course, these are also the reasons why it gives me (luckily the metaphoric) agita. I say this because while I've been asking questions around belonging in college towns and university cities, I'm hoping I get the chance to explore similar questions with East Asian (Korean) / American queer communities as well. You could say that my questions are wholly informed by my own experiences and identities. 

That said, while my research may focus on belonging, I do enjoy some solitude as I woodwork, hike, and try to stay young by lurking on Reddit and pretending to passively play Pokemon Go.
